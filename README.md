### Project Description:
In this exercise, I will be building an application that displays information about movies. I will use jQuery and AJAX methods to parse JSON data returned from
a 3rd party server, TheMovieDB (TMDB) API, to access their movie data.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. An application-programming interface (API) is a set of programming instructions and standards for accessing a
Web-based software application or Web tool. 
2. Developers can make HTTP requests by including method calls in the code of their applications. 
3. AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML and this technology will allow us to load data from
the server without a browser page refresh
